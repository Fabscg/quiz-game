# quiz-game

## This project has been a big challenge for me but it is a great way to make students to think and to google more and more information about coding. many good sources were found and many things to learn.
### It is a site originally call *Code Quiz Game*. It is about a quiz related to coding, it has a timing of 75 seconds and if you pick the wrog answer, then the clock will be substractiong 10 seconds fro your time remaining
